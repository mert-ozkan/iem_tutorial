The [data](https://osf.io/qx94k/?view_only=e256bebd6e7c4f888a696fb35919913d) come from a study [link](NA) where participants were presented two superimposed dot arrays each of which flickered at a distinct frequency (7.5 and 8.57 Hz). The dataframe is the amplitudes from a fast Fourier transform (FFT) procedure belonging to several participants.\n",

In roughly the half of the trials one stimulation frequency represent the attended and the other the unattended. In the remaining half, reverse is true.

Color centers indicate one of 6 equidistant color centers around a isoluminant colorwheel in radians.\n",

    "Procrustes transformation is a set of linear transformation on a hyperspace such that the structure of a matrix A is made similar to matrix B on a hyperspace where each feature indicates a coordinate. Each row/observation in matrix A should match the conditions of interest in matrix B since we want corresponding rows to retain its latent structure so that the underlying experimental manipulations would not be affected by this transformation. Therefore, we need to split our dataframe per peak frequency and subsample and order it in a way that each corresponding row represent the same 'conditions', 'target_frequency', and ' color_center'."
