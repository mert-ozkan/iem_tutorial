# iem_tutorial
Tutorial for building inverted encoding models (IEM) with EEG data. The current repository illustrates several data preprocessing methods to improve IEMs including principal and independent component analyses (PCA, ICA) as well as ridge regularization by shrinkage which is an effective method to reduce multi-collinearities that are present in EEG.
